Michael Nielsen and I got snowed in at RC on Saturday. There were only a few inches of snow on the ground when I showed up around 9 AM. I didn't bother looking outside again until almost 4, when I decided to step out for a snack. Two feet of snow had accumulated. There were no cars on the street. All the stores were closed. I thought the apocalypse had occurred and my only disappointment was that I didn't have my skis. 

What can I say about my last few days of work that's positive? Um. What about my last few days of life? Well, I'm no longer sleeping on M.'s futon. Hooray! And hooray that M. wasn't at all upset about the length of time I'd spent in his living room, and was confused that I was so apologetic. We celebrated my upcoming month in an Airbnb by going to a Uruguayan meathouse. I'll be in Astoria for the next month, which is simultaneously good (a place to live!), bad ($$$$$$!!!!), good (I already know Astoria really well! I love it! It's so convenient to everything!), and bad (I was sort of hoping to explore a new neighborhood).

Work? Well, um. I've been really going crazy with the various functional JavaScript tools (`map`,`reduce`,`filter`, etc.). But. Uh. I'm well inside my comfort zone. I'm not taking full advantage of RC.

I think I should rescind #3 of my New Year's resolutions: "talk about feelings more."

Anyway, someone on Twitter this morning linked to this [LOVELY and WONDERFUL blog post](http://mathlesstraveled.com/2016/01/06/reading-double-and-triple-sided-paper/), the gist of which is, "Can you come up with a good algorithm to read a stack of triple-sided sheets of paper?" Normal pieces of paper have two sides, and so reading an unbound double-sided document can get tricky: you need to a) read both sides of each page, without b) reading out of order, or c) putting the pages back out of order.  But what if you have paper that has THREE sides? (Ignore the physical reality. Just think about this as an abstract concept.) *How do you read a stack of unbound, triple-sided paper?!?*

The blog post doesn't actually answer the question; it poses it, and calls for algorithms in the comments. Of course I am lazy, so as cool of a question as it is, I didn't even try to come up with an algorithm. Which is silly. Gah. 

[The blog as a whole](http://mathlesstraveled.com/) looks fantastic. I want to sit down and read through the archives. Probably it will just make me sad that *I* am not the one writing it. Or writing an equivalent.

I told myself I was going to get back to trying to learn Haskell this week, but other than an hour or two on Monday I haven't. Which is bad. It'd be bad even if I had a good reason ("I've been doing this really cool other thing instead!"), but actually I've had the WORST of reasons: I've been AVOIDING it out of FEAR. Haskell is SCARY. All of those hours and hours of fighting with the compiler my first two weeks were... confidence-destroying. Everyone says (I've heard this for YEARS) that Haskell is amazing and beautiful and amazing once you get over its enormous learning curve. I want to be able to appreciate its beauty!

I promised myself, at the beginning of this week, that I would split my time between Haskell and writing this Tetris-on-polar-coordinates implementation in [D3](http://www.d3js.org). I figured that's the sensible approach: doing the silly JavaScript stuff would give me the psychological positive reinforcement to learn something hard; doing difficult things in small amounts, CONSISTENTLY, sums up to doing big things. Except I've been [non-compliant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compliance_(medicine)) to my own prescription.

The worst part is that the reason it's been so scary is because I've been working on Haskell ENTIRELY ALONE, which is ABSURD, because there are lots of people here who know Haskell reasonably well (or at least better than me), and who are THE NICEST PEOPLE EVER, and who, like everyone else at RC, are SO EAGER to share and learn and teach and help. Difficult things are so much less demoralizing when they're communal. They're also so much EASIER when they're communal. And that's the whole point of RC, and the whole reason I'm here.

Except, no, there WON'T be time, because most of the really cool Haskell people are leaving in two weeks. Argh.

Argh. How was it that Andreas Glaser ended [his *Aims of Education* speech in 2005](https://aims.uchicago.edu/page/2005-andreas-glaeser)?

In other news, whenever I try to read news sites (or other JavaScript-cluttered websites), I have to turn JavaScript off, otherwise Safari will gobble up any remaining RAM and slow the entire ArchaeoBook down to the speed of the [pitch drop experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_drop_experiment). 

That's a fine workaround, except that I keep forgetting to turn JavaScript back ON, and then I go back and try to work on my silly Tetris-in-polar-coordinates implementation, and all of a sudden nothing is working, and I spend ten minutes trying to figure out why nothing is showing up on the screen, and I can't even access any functions or global variables from the console, and I make every fundamental tweak to the code that I can think of, and yet it's like Safari isn't even acknowledging the existence of any of my JavaScript, and this is the most frustrating thing I've ever experienced, and my life is a complete disaster, and I am going to spend the rest of my life unemployed and destitute and bored and miserable and I'm never going to have a sailboat and I'm never going to be on the board of a prominent local non-profit and... and oh. I still have JavaScript disabled.

I think the thing to do is remember that if the ArchaeoBook isn't spinning its fan like it's just received final clearance for takeoff, something's wrong. It's a good thing the air vents are on the side. If they were on the bottom, I'd be worried it would lift up and start floating around my desk, like an air hockey puck. First cell phones that double as digital cameras; next, laptops that double as hovercraft.
