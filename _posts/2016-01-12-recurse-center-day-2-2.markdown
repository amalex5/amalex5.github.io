Just so I'm not avoiding reality: I got nothing done today. It sucked. (Arguably, I got LESS than nothing done, although maybe that requires a more complex ontological framework.)

I did, however, stumble across [this really interesting blog post on Philip Guo's website](http://pgbovine.net/high-achievers-turning-thirty.htm). A year and a bit ago, when he turned 30, he sent out an informal survey to 150 friends and acquaintances, all of more or less the same age and educational/socio-economic background, asking them two (free response) questions: 1) compared to when they were 20, what (non-material) thing did they have MORE of?, and 2) compared to when they were 20, what non-material thing did they have LESS of? 

His results aren't particularly surprising (more confidence, less optimism, more responsibilities, less free time), but the discussion is interesting. Mostly, I'm fascinated by the IDEA: asking everyone in your life the same question in a way that's informal yet systematic. You're learning about your cohort's lives in a way that's neither as cold and legalistic as formal, quantitative social science (sorry, K.), nor as haphazardly biased as normal conversations. The latter is how we usually interact with people, but each of our relationships are unique (T. and I always talk about X but never about Y; J. and I always talk about Y but not X), and so the idea of asking EVERYONE the SAME QUESTION is really compelling. 

In a year or two, I'm going to make this my Christmas letter! I like this experiment. I'm going to replicate it.   

Simultaneously, as I was reading Guo's blog post, I was thinking more about [*While We're Young*](https://amalex5.github.io/2016/01/10/recurse-center-day...-something.html). Guo motivates his survey as a teaching tool: "These insights can be useful for high-achieving students who are curious about what might be in store for them over the next decade." I'm a little skeptical about the utility of this motivation. It's not like there's any dearth of advice for young people! Older people love giving younger people advice. The problem is that most (all?) of the really important lessons in life can't be transmitted didactically. Words don't substitute for experience. All the smart, accomplished, 30-ish MIT grads that Guo  is surveying: it's not like at age 20 they were lacking in authority figures or advice! If just TELLING people what to do were useful...

I'm also not convinced that the best way to be a 20-year-old is to be a 30-year-old. 

But, anyway, thinking more about Noah Baumbach, and (unsurprisingly) reading how many of Guo's respondents describe feeling less idealistic as they age, I was thinking: as an older person, what's the best way to think abut younger people? Suppose you're 45, and you see a 25-year-old displaying what you perceive to be arrogance, excessive optimism, naïveté, silly priorities, etc (choose any combination). How should you think/feel/act? Baumbach's characters tend to be condescending. They're smug and self-righteously cynical ("When you're older, you'll understand."). That seems like a terrible way to think, and to treat other people. 

Analogy: when your three-year-old has an imaginary friend, do you tell them that they're not real, and heap scorn on them for believing something so obviously false? Forget about the (horrifically cruel) effect this would have on your child: it doesn't seem like it'd be very fun for YOU. Who wants to be hanging out with a three-year-old and constantly (e.g.) correcting their grammar? Isn't it more fun to be rolling around on the floor with them?

I think of people I know who aren't cynical, and who are otherwise wonderful people, but who nevertheless have extreme difficulty interacting with people who aren't exactly the same as them. They can't interact with people who are older, younger, poorer, less well-educated, etc., than they are. Usually their complaints take the form of other-directed criticism: they can't relate to any of the stupid concerns of their immature 20-year-old intern, or they can't even make small talk with their colleagues because they're all 45 and have three kids and are boring, or they had to suffer through Thanksgiving at the house of relatives who go to church and usually vote Republican.

I'm still not sold on the inherent wisdom of age. So people tend to get more cynical as they age. So what?  When you're young, your wisdom is clouded by inexperience–but when you're older, it's clouded by experience. This is one of the recurring themes in 
 [*East Coker*](http://www.davidgorman.com/4Quartets/2-coker.htm):

>What was to be the value of the long looked forward to,<br>
>Long hoped for calm, the autumnal serenity<br>
>And the wisdom of age? Had they deceived us<br>
>Or deceived themselves, the quiet-voiced elders,<br>
>Bequeathing us merely a receipt for deceit? ...<br>
>
>There is, it seems to us,<br>
>At best, only a limited value<br>
>In the knowledge derived from experience.<br>
>The knowledge imposes a pattern, and falsifies, ...<br>
>
>... Do not let me hear<br>
>Of the wisdom of old men, but rather of their folly,<br>
>Their fear of fear and frenzy, their fear of possession,<br>
>Of belonging to another, or to others, or to God.<br>

You don't age into wisdom, necessarily. Speaking of which: I'll reiterate that I wrote absolutely zero code today, despite setting progressively smaller goals for myself:

> OK, screw Haskell! Get yourself some sort of small success! Just do some of these [Project Euler](http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2011/06/how-i-failed-failed-and-finally-succeeded-at-learning-how-to-code/239855/) problems! Well, okay, those take a bit more concentration than you have right now. Ok, just write something cool in Javascript! No? Or Python? Maybe you need more structure? What if you found a step-by-step tutorial for like [D3.js](http://d3js.org/) or something? You like D3! [You've used it before](http://www.andrusia.com/gearseer)! No? Really? You want to vomit up that Chinese bun? Well, at least do it in the bathroom?

I may have found a place to stay for the rest of January that'll get me out of M.'s living room. It's cheap (relatively) and comes with a dog and is on the UWS! Simultaneously, former college RA D. posted on Facebook that a room is opening up in his apartment in Crown Heights on February 1st. 

In one of the side halls of Grand Central the "[World's Grandest Squash Tournament](http://www.tocsquash.com/)" (sponsored by JP Morgan et al.) is taking place. I extended my commute by 30 minutes to watch. I'm so amazed at how long pro squash players can keep rallies going.
