Lots of things I want to write about. Not enough energy! My attempts to repay my extreme sleep debt this past weekend were for naught; I'd already compromised my immune system enough that I've spent of this week with my biannual cold. Oh well.

I presented my Tetris-on-polar-coordinates implementation today! Everyone loved it! (I don't know why! It's kind of cool, but it's really not as cool as the amount of effort it took to make!) Michael Nielsen loved it and was talking to me before and after about it! 

Even the code isn't all that ugly (at least, except for the last bits of UI that I was hacking together in the last hour before the presentation). But now that I have a working demo, I think my time is best spent on other projects, rather than on polishing this one (decreasing marginal returns and whatnot). I'm relatively pleased with it, though.

I downloaded CyberDuck to try to FTP it to `andrusia.com`. Of course it didn't work. Not CyberDuck's fault. DotEasy's. I hate DotEasy so much. I've hated them for the last 12 years they've hosted my website, and I've made a handful of half-hearted attempts to switch, but they're such goons. (To be fair, running a commodity business sucks, but...)

I've also been doing this MOOC on EdX on "[Functional Programming Through Haskell](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-functional-programming-delftx-fp101x-0)." I'm really, really enjoying it so far. Eric Meijer is fantastic (and not just because of his shirts). I have a lot more thoughts, but in the sake of writing SOMETHING I should probably refrain from trying to express them. Feeling really optimistic about Haskell right now, though!

More things I want to write about. Maybe tomorrow!
