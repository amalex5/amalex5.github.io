Lots of things I want to write about. Not enough energy! My attempts to repay my extreme sleep debt this past weekend were for naught; I'd already compromised my immune system enough that I've spent of this week with my biannual cold. Oh well.

I presented my Tetris-on-polar-coordinates implementation today! Everyone loved it! (I don't know why! It's kind of cool, but it's really not as cool as the amount of effort it took to make!) Michael Nielsen loved it and was talking to me before and after about it! 

Even the code isn't all that ugly (at least, except for the last bits of UI that I was hacking together in the last hour before the presentation). But now that I have a working demo, I think my time is best spent on other projects, rather than on polishing this one (decreasing marginal returns and whatnot). I'm relatively pleased with it, though.

I downloaded CyberDuck to try to FTP it to `andrusia.com`. Of course it didn't work. Not CyberDuck's fault. DotEasy's. I hate DotEasy so much. I've hated them for the last 12 years they've hosted my website, and I've made a handful of half-hearted attempts to switch, but they're such goons. (To be fair, running a commodity business sucks, but...)

I've also been doing this MOOC on EdX on "[Functional Programming Through Haskell](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-functional-programming-delftx-fp101x-0)." I'm really, really enjoying it so far. Eric Meijer is fantastic (and not just because of his shirts). I have a lot more thoughts, but in the sake of writing SOMETHING I should probably refrain from trying to express them. Feeling really optimistic about Haskell right now, though!

Also today at presentations, Michael Nielsen talked about the LIGO results. (It's off-topic, he admitted, but he asked for special dispensation from the RC faculty, because "it's like the moon landing.") 

S. gave some demonstrations of old 1980s computer games on an emulator, the point of which was to show how most of these games had timing that was tied to the processor's clock speed. So S. was able to, with a few keystrokes, run, e.g., Tetris and Space Invaders on a Commodore 64 overclocked to three gigahertz, and show how absurdly fast the game was moving. Later S. told me that it was even worse: in most of these old games, movement and key-presses were also tied to the processor speed, so if you try to play Tetris on an emulated overclocked Commodore 64, you press the "left" key for a moment to move the tetromino, and during the one or two hundred milliseconds that they key is depressed, a ZILLION clock cycles pass, and so the program assumes you want to move the tetromino a ZILLION places over to the left.

More things I want to write about. Maybe tomorrow!
