Haskell is so wonderful! I'm having so much fun! It feels like I'm just beginning to understand it, 

Here's something that's amazing about Haskell: the type system. Haskell is "strongly typed," which means that you need to be explicit about whether some variable is an integer or a string (or something else). It also means that you need to be explicit about what types of variables functions take as input and what types they spit out as output. If you try to put a string into a function that takes an integer as input, your program won't even compile!

But it's way cooler than that. Languages like Python or Javascript have a pretty ho-hum type system: variables can be strings, integers, arrays, and maybe a few more things. Maybe you can define custom types, but it's a bit tricky and unusual. In Haskell, writing custom types for your program is one of the biggest features of the language! Haskell's type system is like a programming language INSIDE a programming language. It's almost like objects and classes in more object-oriented languages, but much less lackadaisical. When you're writing types, you're basically writing a program that Haskell will use to verify that you wrote the program that you intended to program!

All of this is kind of vague and abstract. I'd include some examples, but I don't understand it particularly well. Also, I can't vouch for the accuracy of anything I said. But here's something that's really cool: [as a thought experiment/joke, someone wrote a basic implementation of Lisp INSIDE Haskell's type system](https://github.com/seliopou/typo). 

H. and A. spent two-and-a-half days writing a Chrome extension to search New York City's 311 API for information on a given rental property [and got featured on Gizmodo](http://gizmodo.com/check-the-history-of-complaints-at-any-nyc-address-with-1764099069). E. was in town Monday and Tuesday to take his certification exam for appraising fine art prints and lithographs. I spent all day Sunday hiking at Bear Mountain with a bunch of Recursers.
