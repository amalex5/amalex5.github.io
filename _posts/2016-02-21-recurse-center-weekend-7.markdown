Here is my current to-do list:

1. Figure out this stuff about parsers in Haskell. (Erik Meijer's lectures on parsing in Haskell seem to assume that the audience has taken classes in formal languages; that's not such a problem, but then the code he's showing in the lectures won't compile. Argh. Maybe I should ask S.)

2. Finish reading this [essay about monads](http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~pszgmh/monads). Then read it again and take notes.

3. Read Michael Nielsen's essay draft. (I had idly mentioned to him, when he was showing me his demo, that he should send me a draft or something. Then, a few days ago, he did! I'm deeply flattered and honored, but it's rather dense, and his main motivating example is a proof in linear algebra, which in principle I'm sure I could follow, but it'd take work... certainly I can't offer any substantive commentary about his essay, but I want to at least be able to ask him questions!!! TAKE ADVANTAGE OF YOUR OPPORTUNITIES, ANDREW!)

4. Write profound/overdue thank-you note to R. (before it becomes profoundly overdue).

5. Finish writing Haskell implementation of that all-the-different-ways-to-make-change problem. 

6. Finish writing JavaScript implementation of (pseudo) hash table

7. Finish writing JavaScript implementation of linked lists

8. Write silly Chrome extension to change number systems.

9. Write Great-Aunt E.

10. Organize dinner with S., T., and K.

11. Start writing symbolic differentiator in Haskell.

12. Write a [redacted].

13. Feel more relaxed.

14. Find somewhere to live for next month (i.e., starting in a week).

15. Do laundry. Also, be sure to pre-treat t-shirt armpits to get gross waxy deodorant deposits out. See if laundry place will fix embarrassing crotch seam rip in nylon pants.

16. Haircut.

17. Organize this to-do list by importance.

16. Organize this to-do list by expected value (i.e., some product of how important each item is times how much time/effort it'll take to get done.)

18. Start doing the things on this list.
