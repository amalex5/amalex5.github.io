I really want to write something more, but I'm too exhausted, and I appear to be coming down with my annual cold. Here are some links *du jour* instead:

- Michael Nielsen, RC's resident Research Fellow (and Resident Australian), has [a fantastic online book about neural networks](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/) (with interactive JavaScript visualizations). 

- A bunch of people at RC today got excited about [a new font from <strike>Hoefler Frere-Jones</strike> Hoefler & Co. designed for code editors](http://www.typography.com/blog/introducing-operator/) (with an accompanying video). It looks really pretty!

- Usually we think of subway stations as being POINTS, since that's how they're represented on the canonical MTA map (and most urban-transit maps). But of course subway stations are actually complicated concatenations [0] of spaghetti, splayed in all three dimensions! This guy has been doing [beautiful illustrations of various NYC subway stations, as schematic line-art](http://www.projectsubwaynyc.com/gallery/). There are gorgeous prints, tooâ€“there's one hanging next to me right now in RC, which is how I learned about them!

- The New York Times suggests that [Namibia should be my next desert](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/31/travel/namibia-tour-road-trip.html). It's not mentioned in the article, but Namibia is also a [popular (useful) place for astrophysics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Astronomical_observatories_in_Namibia). 

- Probabilistic data structures are really cool, and visualizations of [rapidly-expanding random trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapidly_exploring_random_tree) look like suburban sprawl.

Blargh. Off to take the subway home, go running, take a long decongestive shower, and SLEEP.

[0] not the right word, I know, but I couldn't resist the alliteration.
