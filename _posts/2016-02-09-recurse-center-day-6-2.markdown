I really want to write something more, but I'm too exhausted, and I appear to be coming down with my annual cold. Here are some links *du jour* instead:

- Michael Nielsen, RC's resident Research Fellow (and Resident Australian), has [a fantastic online book about neural networks](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/) (with interactive JavaScript visualizations). 

- A bunch of people at RC today got excited about [a new font from <strike>Hoefler Frere-Jones</strike> Hoefler & Co. designed for code editors](http://www.typography.com/blog/introducing-operator/) (with an accompanying video). It looks really pretty!

- Usually we think of subway stations as being POINTS, since that's how they're represented on the canonical MTA map (and most urban-transit maps). But of course subway stations are actually complicated concatenations [0] of spaghetti, splayed in all three dimensions! This guy has been doing [beautiful illustrations of various NYC subway stations, as schematic line-art](http://www.projectsubwaynyc.com/gallery/). There are gorgeous prints, too–there's one hanging next to me right now in RC, which is how I learned about them!

- The New York Times suggests that [Namibia should be my next desert](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/31/travel/namibia-tour-road-trip.html). It's not mentioned in the article, but Namibia is also a [popular (useful) place for astrophysics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Astronomical_observatories_in_Namibia). 

- Probabilistic data structures are really cool, and visualizations of [rapidly-expanding random trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapidly_exploring_random_tree) look like suburban sprawl.

- The Wikipedia article on the "[Public Land Survey System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Land_Survey_System)" (i.e., the grid that covers most of the land between the Appalachian fall line and the Rockies) is really interesting. It taught me the name of a concept I've known about (and loved!) for years: "cadastral maps," i.e., maps that show property parcel boundaries, and which often include ownership/address/survey information for each parcel. (There's a huge, wall-sized cadastral map of Cayuga Heights in the clerk's office in Marcham Hall!)

- "I have had people ask me what it is like to do research in mathematics, and perhaps the answer is that it is like a snowstorm. As the snow falls, the light dims and the world goes gray. Local distinctions are lost, sharp curves disappear, and the world is made softer, quieter, and simpler. When the sun comes out, the way we see the world has been transformed to a place of startling clarity and simplicity. A ski area in summer is a rugged, foreboding place, full of crags, rocks and brush, rough to look at and to hike. But the snow falls, and fills the holes and softens the points, and the jagged becomes smooth. A snow-covered hill is a mathematician’s dream come to this earth. All detail is gone, and there is nothing but the surface itself. This is the joy captured by the helicopter shot of the lone skier in the untrammelled backcountry bowl. At that moment the skier experiences a pure surface, and there is nothing but the contour of the the slope. The skier might be a drop of milk rolling down the side of a ceramic breakfast bowl. The snow-covered hills resemble nothing so much as the abstract surfaces that mathematicians draw for themselves on blackboards (with white chalk)—the simplest set of curves, which only convey shape. The snow-covered world is an abstraction of the world that lies underneath: the details are smoothed over, the color is removed, all that is left is an essence of shape. These are the forms that one can work with. This is how the mathematician thinks. This is what she does, in her minds eye, to the world around her."

Blargh. Off to take the subway home, go running, take a long decongestive shower, and SLEEP.

[0] not the right word, I know, but I couldn't resist the alliteration.
