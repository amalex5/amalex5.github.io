M. and I went out and got Tibetan food late last night: hot butter tea, hot milk chai, soup dumplings, unidentified rolled-up noodles stuffed with seitan, and huge bowls of steaming thimphu thenthuk, all in a tiny restaurant hidden behind a cell phone shop in Jackson Heights. Delicious. And only $14 each!

But today! My first day at the Recurse Center! It was full of excitement! It was full of anxiety! Here are some thoughts:

## Boring but important:

1. *Housing*. Breaking my promise to myself, I did basically nothing as far as finding an apartment goes, other than to discover the (Bushwick Boarding Bazaar)[https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=487172681436613] Facebook group and message one of the posters in it. My anxiety about housing was/has been slightly lessened in the short term by M.'s enormous generosity/hospitality/friendliness, but I shouldn't let that induce complacency in myself (and thus take advantage of M.'s kindness). Tomorrow I should go through the most recent (Listings Project)[https://www.listingsproject.com/] email and email anything that looks promising. That'll be easier to do in bulk: I'll write a brief, charming email about myself, have some wonderful colleague at the RC reassure me that it looks good, and copy-paste.

2. *Computer*. I think I can probably keep using this ArchaeoBook for a while? I mean, it does run the Haskell compiler, and as long as none of them are too JavaScripty, I can have like three or even four browser tabs open at once. (But I definitely can't have Gmail open at the same time as Zulip, RC's cool internal chat system/Slack equivalent.) In general my financial philosophy is to not spend money unless it's absolutely necessary.

  If I did want to buy a new MacBook, though, it seems I could order one with the education discount online (!) and then pick it up at the SoHo Apple Store (the same day!). Or even just go to the Apple Store with my no-expiration-date UChicago ID and pick one up. Wow, that seems so crazily easy. Not the education discount, just the *buying the computer*. I mean, I don't think I've ever bought a computer not-online (and not without months of agonizing beforehand).

## Less boring, still important:

1. In the morning today, I was smiley and charismatic and excited Andrew! In the afternoon, after I started sitting down to actually think about Haskell (I was too frightened to even think about thinking about applied topology), I was... the not-smiley and not-talkative and anxious Andrew. You drive up into Yosemite Valley, and it's beautiful, and you smell the pine trees, and you hear the Mariposa River splashing over rocks, and you're all excited to be there... and then you actually stand at the base of Half Dome, and you realize that you have to actually climb up this unbroken vertical wall of rock.

[0] I suspect this is a really bad metaphor; my guess is that anyone who actually has the climbing skills to climb Half Dome is a lot less intimidated in this situation: it's work, sure, but it's not frightening work, because you've trained enough that it's instinctive. But the "bottom of the sheer cliff" imagery is the way I usually think about my math-related anxieties. For the sake of actually publishing a blog post tonight I probably can't attempt to be more precise!

"sure, i might be unemployed, but did i mention that I went to the university of –––––"
re-reading m beyond m on friday deeply inspiring portrait and a very worthwhile book but not a very well-written one. it feels like a new yorker profile, which would be great if it were the length of a new yorker profile, but doesn't work as well when it's a 200 page book. ANYWAY, what i was going to say was that tracy kidder (way overrated) "tracy kidder, a graduate of harvard university, is also the author of..." 
is it modesty? is it deliberate? or are people not proud of and excited by where they went to school? i am deeply grateful for, and rightly proud of, my education at IHS and the U of C. (Am I *too* proud?) 
and like there's a way of thinking about that that's pretentious and elitist (I went to ______––where did *you* go to school?), and that's certainly not absent from my soul when I ask that question. 
'because i think i've been in a handful of other social settings in which "where did you go to school?" wasn't a default question or fact to discover. But in the vast majority of settings I've been in, it has.

what were we excited about
and what were we nervous about
calling out
i didn't say anything
i wonder what's the best way to get everyone to participate?
maybe get everyone to write down thigns first, and then speak
other people worried about finding projects
everyone weirded out by unstructured time
but for me, unstructured time is ALL I'VE HAD the last three years! 

not talking about where went to school
like not at al
even in a "in cambridge" 

what i didn't do: write lots of code!

trains and the enormous amount of momentum it takes to start them––but then the massive amount of momentum they have at cruising speed

projects give direction/goals
which can make up for lack of momentum
(alternatively, momentum without a goal can be OK––you might not be sure exactly where you're moving, but you're moving somewhere, and sometimes the goals reveal themselves later.)
