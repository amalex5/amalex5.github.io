I got Haskell running on my archaeological MacBook! (Or, to be more specific, I got [GHC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasgow_Haskell_Compiler), the main compiler for Haskell, running.)

I am delinquent: I promised myself in my last blog post that I'd do it on Friday. Instead I did it today, Saturday, though technically I didn't get it running until 1 AM Sunday (approximate time right now), and in any case I was only trying to install it as a way of procrastinating packing and cleaning. But it's working! I typed "ghci" into the command line, and poof! interactive Haskell! It correctly told me that 5+7 (my favorite one-digit numbers) is 12. I left some tabs with chapters from [Learn You A Haskell For Great Good](http://learnyouahaskell.com/) open, so maybe tomorrow on the bus to New York I'll fool around some more. (More likely I will just sleep, though. I need to: between travel to Portland and prepping for RC, I've been running a bit of a sleep deficit the past week.)

Fun details: I installed the [Haskell Platform](https://www.haskell.org/platform/), which is "Haskell with batteries included," which in un-clichéd language means that it's GHC, a debugger, a bunch of useful packages, and a build system. To install the Haskell Platform I had to install Xcode (Apple's developer/Unix tools), or rather "Xcode Developer Tools," which is a subset containing (I guess) just gcc, make, git, and some other basic unix/command line utilities. I'm running 10.6.8 on the ArchaeoBook, so I had to find an old version, and ended up downloading the released-in-2010 [Xcode 3.2.2 Developer Tools](http://adcdownload.apple.com/Developer_Tools/xcode_3.2.2_developer_tools_beta_20728/xcode322_2148_developerdvd.dmg) (free registration required).

Off to New York tomorrow! M. is letting me stay with him in his palace in outer Queens ("but I'm slammed with this book project, so I might not get to see you all that much.") Earlier today I was re-reading the action-packed chapter of the *Bros. K.* where Ivan, fed up and frustrated, finally storms out of his father's house in his

>At seven o'clock in the evening Ivan Fyodorovich boarded the train and flew towards Moscow. "Away with all the past, I'm through with the old world forever, and may I never hear another word or echo from it; to the new world, to new places, and no looking back!" But instead of delight, such darkness suddenly descended on his soul, and such grief gnawed at his heart, as he had never known before in the whole of his life. He sat thinking all night; the train flew on, and only at daybreak, entering Moscow, did he suddenly come to, as it were.
